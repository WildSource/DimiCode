# DimiCore

Toy programming language for me to implement to learn how to write an interpreter.
Syntax and features generated by chatgpt.

## Features:
    - Variables and data types (integers and strings)
    - Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
    - Control flow (if/else statements, loops)
    - Input/output (printing to the console, reading user input)

## Basic Syntax
Variables and Data Types
```DimiCore
# Declaring variables
x = 5
y = "hello"

# Data types
int age = 30
string name = "John"

```

## Arithmetic Operations

```DimiCore
# Addition
x = 5 + 3

# Subtraction
y = 10 - 2

# Multiplication
z = 2 * 4

# Division
w = 20 / 4
```

## Control Flow
```DimiCore
# If statement
if x > 3 {
  print("x is greater than 3")
} else {
  print("x is less than or equal to 3")
}

# While loop
i = 0
while i < 10 {
  print(i)
  i = i + 1
}
```

## Input/Output
```DimiCore
# Printing to the console
print("Hello, world!")

# Reading user input
name = read()
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```
